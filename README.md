# Vibe Worldbuilding MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for creating detailed fictional worlds with Claude, complete with automatic image generation.

## Overview

This MCP helps you build rich, cohesive fictional worlds through a structured approach to worldbuilding. It uses Claude's capabilities to help you develop concepts, explore details, and maintain consistency. The MCP can also generate images to visually represent your world's elements using Google's Imagen API.

## Features

- **Structured Worldbuilding Prompts**: Guided workflows for developing different aspects of your world
- **Content Management**: Save, read, and organize your worldbuilding content in markdown files  
- **Image Generation**: Create visual representations of your world elements using Google Imagen
- **Consistency Tools**: Review and maintain coherence across your world's elements
- **Flexible Workflow**: Support for both new projects and continuing existing work

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MCP CLI tool
- FAL API key (for image generation)

### Setup

1. **Install the MCP CLI**:
   ```bash
   pip install mcp
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get a FAL API Key**:
   - Visit [FAL AI](https://fal.ai/)
   - Create an account and get your API key for Imagen4 access

4. **Install the Vibe Worldbuilding MCP**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vibe-worldbuilder
   mcp install vibe_worldbuilding_server.py -v FAL_KEY=your_fal_api_key_here
   ```

   The `-v` flag sets the environment variable needed for image generation. If you don't have a FAL API key, you can still use the MCP for worldbuilding without image generation:
   ```bash
   mcp install vibe_worldbuilding_server.py
   ```

### Development Mode

To test the MCP in development mode:
```bash
mcp dev vibe_worldbuilding_server.py -v FAL_KEY=your_fal_api_key_here
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this MCP with Claude Desktop, add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-worldbuilding": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/vibe-worldbuilder/vibe_worldbuilding_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "FAL_KEY": "your_fal_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/path/to/vibe-worldbuilder/` with the actual absolute path to your vibe-worldbuilder directory, and replace `your_fal_api_key_here` with your actual FAL API key.

The configuration file is typically located at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## How to Use

The MCP provides several prompts to guide your worldbuilding process:

### Available Prompts

- **start-worldbuilding** - Begin a new world project
- **continue-worldbuilding** - Resume work on an existing world
- **world-foundation** - Develop the core concepts of your world
- **taxonomy** - Create classification systems for world elements
- **world-entry** - Create detailed entries for specific elements
- **consistency-review** - Check for logical consistency
- **entry-revision** - Revise and improve existing entries
- **workflow** - Get guidance on the overall process

### Available Tools

- **save_world_content** - Save worldbuilding content to markdown files
- **read_world_content** - Read existing worldbuilding files
- **list_world_files** - List all worldbuilding files in a directory
- **instantiate_world** - Create a complete world project structure in a uniquely named folder with optional initial taxonomies and descriptions
- **create_taxonomy_folders** - Add new taxonomy categories with descriptions to an existing world project
- **create_world_entry** - Create entries within taxonomies that automatically reference the taxonomy overview
- **generate_image_from_markdown_file** - Generate images from your content (requires API key)

## Image Generation

The MCP can generate images for your world elements using FAL's Imagen4 API. After creating a markdown file for an entry, taxonomy, or other element:

1. Use the `generate_image_from_markdown_file` tool with the path to your markdown file
2. The tool will:
   - Read the content of your markdown file
   - Extract the title and description
   - Generate an appropriate image using FAL's Imagen4 API
   - Save the image in an "images" folder next to your markdown file
3. Options available:
   - **Style**: Art style for the image (default: "fantasy illustration")
   - **Aspect ratio**: Choose from 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 3:4, or 4:3

You can then upload the generated image to Claude to view it in your conversation.

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start** with the `start-worldbuilding` prompt to begin
2. **Create** your world foundation document with core concepts
3. **Instantiate** your world project using the `instantiate_world` tool with your foundation content
4. **Add taxonomies** as needed using `create_taxonomy_folders` with descriptions of how they apply to your world
5. **Develop** specific entries using `create_world_entry` which automatically references the taxonomy context
6. **Generate** images for your world elements to bring them to life visually
7. **Review** regularly for consistency and coherence using the consistency-review prompt
8. **Continue** each new session with `continue-worldbuilding`

## Example Session

```
User: Let's create a new world.

[User selects the "start-worldbuilding" prompt from the MCP menu]

Claude: [Displays the worldbuilding prompt]

User: I'd like to create a world where sound has magical properties.

Claude: [Helps develop the concept and explores implications]

User: Let's create the world project structure.

Claude: [Uses instantiate_world tool with the world content and any initial taxonomies]

User: I want to add a "religions" taxonomy to develop the belief systems.

Claude: [Uses create_taxonomy_folders tool with taxonomy name and description of how religions work in this world]

User: Let me create an entry for the "Church of Resonance".

Claude: [Uses create_world_entry tool which automatically includes the religions taxonomy context]

User: Now generate an image for the world overview.

[User uses the generate_image_from_markdown_file tool]

Claude: [Generates an image and saves it to the images folder]
```

## File Organization

The MCP automatically creates organized project folders and will create:

### Project Structure
Each world gets its own unique folder named: `{world-name}-{unique-suffix}`

**Unique suffix options**:
- `timestamp` (default): `my-world-20250603-143022`
- `uuid`: `my-world-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`  
- `short-uuid`: `my-world-a1b2c3d4`

### Folder Structure
- **overview/**: Core world documents and foundation
- **taxonomies/**: Taxonomy overview files (no subfolders)
- **entries/**: Detailed entries organized by taxonomy
- **images/**: Centralized image storage organized by category
- **notes/**: Development notes and work-in-progress content

### File Organization
- `overview/world-overview.md` - Core world concept
- `taxonomies/{category}-overview.md` - Taxonomy descriptions (flat structure)
- `entries/{category}/{entry-name}.md` - Detailed world elements
- `images/{category}/{image-name}.png` - Organized visual content

## Requirements

- **FAL API key** for Imagen4 (set as the `FAL_KEY` environment variable)
- **Requests Python library** (`requests`)
- **MCP CLI tool**

## Tips for Success

- **Build incrementally** - Start with core concepts before diving into details
- **Create clusters** of related content that build on each other
- **Review regularly** for consistency and logical coherence
- **Focus on quality** over quantity - fewer, well-developed elements are better
- **Follow your interests** - Let your world emerge organically
- **Use images** to inspire further worldbuilding and bring concepts to life

## Troubleshooting

### Image Generation Issues

- **No API key**: Set the `FAL_KEY` environment variable
- **API errors**: Check your FAL API quota and billing status
- **Import errors**: Install `requests` with `pip install requests`

### File Issues

- **Permission errors**: Ensure you have write permissions in your working directory
- **Path issues**: Use absolute paths or ensure your working directory is correct
