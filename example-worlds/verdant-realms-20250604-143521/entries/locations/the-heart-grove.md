## Visitor's Account
"Words fail. In the Heart Grove, I was simultaneously plant and animal, earth and sky, past and future. I understood the language of stones and heard the dreams of trees. For seven sunsets, I was not myself but part of everything. The memory both haunts and heals me. I am changed forever, and grateful for it." - Mira Soulweaver, Human Mystic
