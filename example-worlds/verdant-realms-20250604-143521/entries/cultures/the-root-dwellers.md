# The Root Dwellers

## Overview
The Root Dwellers represent one of Verdant Realms' most unique human cultures, having adapted to life in the vast underground root networks beneath the great forests. These people have evolved both culturally and physically to thrive in the twilight world between surface and deep earth, creating a sophisticated civilization in harmony with the living root systems that shelter them.

## History and Origins
### The Great Descent
Approximately 800 years ago, during a period known as the "Burning Sky," a group of surface dwellers fled underground to escape a catastrophic event. They discovered that the root systems of ancient trees created vast cathedral-like spaces below ground, filled with breathable air and filtered light.

### Cultural Evolution

## Anthropologist's Note
"The Root Dwellers challenge our assumptions about human adaptability and the requirements for civilization. In choosing the depths over the surface, they've created not a lesser society but a different oneâ€”one that hears the heartbeat of the earth and speaks in the language of roots. Their existence poses profound questions about humanity's relationship with the underground world we so often ignore." - Dr. Petra Deepdelver, Underground Anthropologist
