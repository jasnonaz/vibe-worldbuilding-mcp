"To meet a Grove Shepherd is to understand your own insignificance and importance simultaneously. They move with the patience of centuries and the urgency of seasons. In their ancient eyes, you see every tree that has ever grown and every forest yet to be. They are not merely guardians of the woodsâ€”they ARE the woods, given form and purpose." - Elder Druid Thornweave
