## Getting Started

1. Review your world overview in `overview/world-overview.md`
2. Use the `create_taxonomy_folders` tool to add new taxonomies as needed
3. Define your taxonomies and create detailed entries
4. Generate images to visualize key concepts

## Taxonomy Development

As you develop your world, you'll identify key categories that need systematic development. Use the worldbuilding MCP to:
- Create folders for new taxonomies as they emerge
- Maintain consistency across related elements
- Build comprehensive classification systems
